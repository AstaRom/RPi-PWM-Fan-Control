# Raspberry-Pi-PWM-fan
Based on [DriftKingTW's instructable.](https://github.com/DriftKingTW) 

I use a 25mm 5V 0,2A fan.

[The circuit needed to drive it], view: fan_circuit [pwm].png
* 5V, GND and GPIO inputs (from left to right)
* 1kOhm resistor
* a 2N2222 NPN transistor
* a diode
* 5V and GND output for the fan (from left to right)
